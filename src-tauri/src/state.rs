//! Core state machine. Every state transition flows through `transition()`,
//! which validates the edge, runs side effects, and emits `state-changed`.
//!
//! Veil locks only on an explicit user action (menubar "Lock now" or the global
//! hotkey). After a successful unlock it returns to `Idle` — it does NOT re-lock
//! on focus loss. Hence there is no `Armed` state and no focus watcher.
